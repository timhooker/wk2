// TODO: Write a number guessing game.
//
// Rules: The game will generate a number between 1 and 10,
// inclusive. So, it might generate a 1. Or it might generate
// a 10, or any whole number in between.
//
// The user should enter a number into the text box and then
// click "guess".
//
// You should then tell the user (via alert or another way)
// if her guess was too big, too small, or just right!
//
//
// Look at the HTML, and note that you'll need to
// write two functions:
//
// setGuess(guessValueAsString)
// guess()
//
// Feel free to rename the guessValueAsString parameter
